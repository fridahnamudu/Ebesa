                                Faculty of Engineering introduced a section in Agricultural Engineering focusing on Agricultural Process Engineering. </p>
                
                                <!-- <p>The Department of Agricultural Engineering of University of Nairobi was established in 1975 originally as the Department of Agricultural Mechanization and Farm planning. 
                                The name was then changed in 1976 to Department of Agricultural Engineering.</p> -->

                                <p>In 2003, the University of Nairobi senate ratified the change of name of the Department and the degree program to 
                                Environmental and Biosystems engineering to reflect the content and intent of the Department's academic, 
                                research and consultancy services and to keep in tune with the expanding global challenges and demands.</p>
